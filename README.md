Parkinson’s Disease Detection using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning based healthcare application that predicts Parkinson’s Disease using biomedical voice measurements. The system analyzes vocal frequency features and classifies whether a person is healthy or affected.

Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Working

1. Dataset containing biomedical voice features is preprocessed
2. Features are normalized and selected
3. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained
4. The trained model predicts Parkinson’s Disease

How to Run

1. Download the repository
2. Install libraries
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run
   python application.py

Output

The system predicts whether the patient is Parkinson positive or healthy.
